@implementation OIInspector (RSExtensions)

// Copied from Graffle's InspectorPanel.m
// see <bug://bugs/55083>; this is necessary to capture text field edits if another control is used. The problem is that -updateDisplay resets the values and discards any edits. Thus, sending -makeFirstResponder:nil will confirm and commit the edit. Note that setting the first responder to the control results in the focus ring drawing around the control which then results in some strange drawing issues. Since each inspector is in its own window, it is necessary to make the calling inspector key.
- (void)updateKeyWindowAndFirstResponder:(id)sender;
{
    if ([[[NSApplication sharedApplication] keyWindow] isKindOfClass:[NSPanel class]])
        [[sender window] makeKeyWindow];
    [[sender window] makeFirstResponder:nil];
}
